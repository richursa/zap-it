# zap-it
ever wanted to send data over the internet or over wifi but afraid of neighbourhood auntys who watch everything even snoop on your data!fear no more use zapsend and zaprecv to send data over the internet encrypted using aes128bit encryption !works fine on lan but enable port forwarding when behind nat or a router!!


download zap-it_1.0_all.deb and install it using the command "sudo dpkg -i zap-it*.deb"
then run the command "zapsend" on the pc from which file is to be sent and "zaprecv" on the pc where file is to be recived
